<h1>The Best Ice cream by Me</h1>
<h2>My top three Ice creams of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Butterscotch</h3>
<p>It is creamy, buttery and very rich in flavour. The best part is the nuts (?) in them that also gives it a cruncy texture. 9 out of 10.</p>
<h3>Vanilla</h3>
<P>Though it is a universal equivalent to basic, that is exactly what makes it shine. Vanilla is good by itself, no doubt, it is soothing and rich. 
    But get sizzling chocolate and bam! 
    Now it tastes of chocolate. 
    Got Strawberry, Mango, Coffee, Hazelnut, or Carmel Syrup?
     Bam! You have a whole new flavour. 
     Put it in a milkshake. Add it on your brownie. 
     An overall all rounder. 9.5 out of 10.</P>

<h3>Chocolate</h3>
<p>Personally, not a huge fan of chocolate. But it is one of the best.
    It is adjacent to vanilla in a way. One of those cravings that can only
    Be fulfilled by chocolate sometimes. And it is best at what it does.
    It pairs well with nuts, fruits, other ice creams, milkshakes and most 
    deserts. 8 out of 10.
